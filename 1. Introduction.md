# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Introduction
Hello! Welcome to the "Fundamentals of SIEM Alert Rule Development" course by Purple Academy.

This course is the second one of the "Proactive Security Operations Center (SOC") learning path. By the end of this course, you will have learned about the fundamentals of SIEM technology, challenges in alert rule development, and some approaches to solve these challenges, such as detection as code approach, and "Alert Rule Development Life Cycle" offered by Picus.

We also provide 10 recommendations to solve main challenges, such as identifying gaps, implementing and testing rules, fine-tuning rule base, and keeping up with the threat landscape.

## 1.2 Security Operations Center (SOC)
First of all, I want to introduce SOC with three slides. If you already took the Fundamentals of Modern Log Management Practices course, you can skip these slides.

Let's start with overview of the Security Operations Center. A SOC refers to people, processes, and technologies responsible for monitoring, analyzing, maintaining, and improving an organization's cybersecurity.

A SOC is not a room with large monitors on the wall; it is a capability composed of three building blocks: people, process, and technology.

- The first building block of a SOC is the People. A SOCconsists of different roles including SOC analyst, incident responder, threat hunter, and SOC manager. Some mature Security Operations Centers also include compliance auditor and security architect roles.
- The second building block is Processes. Defining clear, robust, and repeatable processes brings a good foundation for the actions a SOC member takes. A SOC lacks guidance and produces inconsistent results if these processes aren't in place. We will see key SOC operations in the next slide.
- The third building block is Technology. An effective SOC incorporates data from various sources and analyzes and manages data. The core technology of a successful SOC is an enterprise-wide data collection, management, detection, and analytics solution.

## 1.3 Reactive SOCs to Proactive SOCs
Now, I want to describe the differences between a reactive SOC and a proactive SOC. 

- The proactive SOC concept defines transformed Security Operations Center where visibility is enhanced and maintained to contextualize threats and attacks surface continuously, instead of unselected data collection to achieve visibility. 
- Detection capabilities are constantly updated against the anticipated attacks to filter out noise, and they are updated and fixed against the changing adversaries landscape instead of unselective alert triage by triaging as many alerts as possible. 
- And finally, response capabilities allow focusing on dealing with advanced threats by establishing an agile and automated incident response process and driving mitigation on network and endpoint security controls to achieve a more robust defense baseline.
